- "Chinese Idiom instruction meets Uber at nuclear test sites"

- Generate 64 possible readings to pull from, make them unique for every reading
- 8 different types of "particles", and the pygame screen has 6 sections
- Based on where and in what frequency the 8 different particles end up in the simulation, we will get our reading.
- Make it interactive so that the user can play
